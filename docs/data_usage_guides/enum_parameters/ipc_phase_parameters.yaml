- IPC Phase: 1
  Name: None/Minimal
  Description: Households are able to meet essential food and non-food needs without engaging in atypical and unsustainable strategies to access food and income.
- IPC Phase: 2
  Name: Stressed
  Description: Households have minimally adequate food consumption but are unable to afford some essential non-food expenditures without engaging in stress-coping strategies.
- IPC Phase: 3
  Name: Crisis
  Description: Households either have food consumption gaps that are reflected by high or above-usual acute malnutrition, or are marginally able to meet minimum food needs but only by depleting essential livelihood assets or through crisis-coping strategies.
- IPC Phase: 4
  Name: Emergency
  Description: Households either have large food consumption gaps which are reflected in very high acute malnutrition and excess mortality, or are able to mitigate large food consumption gaps but only by employing emergency livelihood strategies and asset liquidation.
- IPC Phase: 5
  Name: Catastrophe/Famine
  Description: Households have an extreme lack of food and/or other basic needs even after full employment of coping strategies. Starvation, death, destitution and extremely critical acute malnutrition levels are evident. (For Famine Classification, an area needs to have extreme critical levels of acute malnutrition and mortality.)
- IPC Phase: 3+
  Name: In Need of Action
  Description: Sum of population in phases 3, 4, and 5. The population in Phase 3+ does not necessarily reflect the full population in need of urgent action. This is because some households may be in Phase 2 or even 1 but only because of receipt of assistance, and thus, they may be in need of continued action.
- IPC Phase: all
  Name: Population
  Description: Total population
