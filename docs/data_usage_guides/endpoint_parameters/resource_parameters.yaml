- Parameter: '`hdx_id`'
  Description: >
    Unique resource UUID on HDX, which does not change even when changes
    are made to the resource. In combination with the dataset UUID from the
    `dataset_hdx_id` field, it can be used to construct a link to the resource
    on HDX:
    `https://data.humdata.org/dataset/[dataset_hdx_id]/resource/[hdx_id]`,
    which can be found in the `hdx_link` field.
    It can also be used to access the resource through the HDX CKAN API:
    `https://data.humdata.org/api/action/resource_show?id=[hdx_id]`,
    which is shown in the `hdx_api_link` field.
