- parameter: '`hdx_id`'
  description: >
    Unique dataset UUID on HDX, which does not change even when changes are
    made to the dataset. It can be used to construct a link to the dataset
    on HDX:
    `https://data.humdata.org/dataset/[hdx_id]`,
    which you can find in the `hdx_link` field.
    It can also be used to access the dataset through the HDX CKAN API:
    `https://data.humdata.org/api/action/package_show?id=[hdx_id]`
  source:
- parameter: '`hdx_stub`'
  description: >
    The dataset URL stub can be used to construct a human-readable link to the
    dataset on HDX as follows:
    `https://data.humdata.org/dataset/[hdx_stub]`.
    The stub may change at any time (unlike the UUID).

    `https://data.humdata.org/organization/[hdx_provider_stub],
    and to the dataset provider's information on the HDX CKAN API:
    `https://data.humdata.org/api/action/organization_show?id=[hdx_provider_stub]`
