# Summary

For full documentation visit [the reference documentation - TBD](fix/this/link).

HAPI is a service of the [Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX)](https://data.humdata.org), part of UNOCHA's [Centre for Humanitarian Data](https://centre.humdata.org). The purpose of HAPI is to improve access to key humanitarian datasets taken from the HDX catalog data to better support automated visualisation and analysis. HAPI is primarily intended for application developers and data scientists working within the humanitarian community.

HAPI provides a consistent, standardised and machine-readable interface to query and retrieve data from a set of high-value humanitarian indicators drawn from the HDX catalogue. With HAPI, the HDX team aims to provide a single point of access to critical humanitarian data in a standardised and structured way. 

As of November 2023, the number of indcators in HAPI is limited, and work is ongoing to continually add more data. The initial scope of HAPI will be the data included in the [HDX Data Grids](https://data.humdata.org/dashboards/overview-of-data-grids).
